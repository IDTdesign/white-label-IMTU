## International Mobile Top Up

### What is International Mobile Top Up?

<%- @site.companyname %> international mobile top-up is a service that allows you to recharge the mobile phones of your loved ones abroad. Topping up a prepaid mobile phone is quick and easy â€” all you need to know is your recipient's country, mobile phone service provider ("carrier") and mobile phone number.


### How do I send an International Mobile Top Up?

Adding funds is easy. Follow these steps:

1. Enter an international mobile phone number
2. Confirm the mobile carrier
3. Choose an amount that you'd like to send to this number
4. Select a payment method

### How much can I top up at one time?

The amount of the top up you can send will depend on your recipient's country and mobile phone service provider. When you set up your order, you will be able to choose from a list of top up amounts.

### How soon is a top up sent?

We send your order immediately to the mobile phone service provider, who is responsible for processing the top up. Most top ups are delivered to the recipient instantly.

Occasionally a mobile service provider may experience a system delay that prevents a top up from being processed immediately. You and your recipient will both receive an SMS confirmation message when the top up has been completed successfully.

### Why is my top up order not being accepted?

When placing your order, be sure to select the correct mobile service provider ("carrier") for the mobile phone number you wish to top up. If you select the wrong carrier, the top up will not be processed.

Also, be sure you are topping up a prepaid mobile phone. Mobile top up cannot be done for phones that are on post-paid service plans.

### What should I do if the recipient did not receive the top up that I sent?

Please contact [customer service](<%- @getUrl('/templates/support/') %>) and provide the details of your order: the transaction ID number and the recipient's mobile phone number, mobile service provider and country. Our Customer Service team will contact the mobile service provider about your top up.

Occasionally a mobile service provider may experience a system delay that prevents a top up from being processed immediately. If you have received a "Pending" notification in your account's [transaction history](<%- @getUrl('/templates/transactions?option=TM&product_filter=I') %>), please wait until you receive final confirmation of the status of your top up order before contacting us.
